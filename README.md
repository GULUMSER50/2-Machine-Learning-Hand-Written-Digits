Summary of Models:

- Both Random Forest and SVM classifiers were evaluated on the dataset.
- The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.9836 and an F1 score of 0.9839 on the test set. The SVM classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.9894 and an F1 score of 0.9896 on the test set.
- The Random Forest classifier with Grid SearchCV achieved an accuracy of 0.9774 and an F1 score of 0.9778 on the test set. The SVM classifier with Grid SearchCV achieved an accuracy of 0.9898 and an F1 score of 0.9899 on the test set.
- Based on the results and considering factors such as accuracy, F1 score, training time, and interpretability, the SVM classifier appears to be slightly more favorable for this dataset. However, the Random Forest classifier may be a better choice if interpretability and training time are crucial.
